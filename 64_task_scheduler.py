# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

# â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

    def leastInterval(self, tasks: List[str], n: int) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each task

        # Step 2: Calculate the minimum intervals required

        part_length = n + 1  # Each part can hold 'n' idle slots + 1 max frequency task
